### Technical challenges 
The technical challenges that I may face is collecting the correct stones and being able to store and count them according to their designated slots. I plan to solve this by first being able to collect one stone and store and count it properly. Then connecting the designated stone to the designated count. Another challenge I may face is animating the eevee to evolve into its next pokemon.
